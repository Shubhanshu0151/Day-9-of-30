# Day 9 of 30:
### Today, I focused on creating data models, customizing the AppBarTheme, and extracting themes in Flutter. I designed data models to efficiently handle and organize the app's data structure. Customizing the AppBarTheme allowed me to achieve a consistent and aesthetically pleasing app bar across different screens. Furthermore, I worked on extracting and managing themes to maintain a cohesive look and feel throughout the application. This approach not only enhances the visual consistency but also simplifies theme management and updates.

Stay tuned for more updates on my journey! ðŸš€ðŸ“±
